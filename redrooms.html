    <p>I was completely speechless the first time I finished this film. It's not a horror movie per se, more like a dark thriller that sometimes steps into horror territory,
      but let me tell you, there's a point in it I was genuinely TERRIFIED. I'm someone who's always been fascinated with the dark web and who fell down multiple youtube rabbit holes
      watching stuff about red rooms and the Secrets of the dark net so of course the themes of this movie really appealed to me. The cinematography is excellent and the main character is captivating. I will spread the Red Rooms 
      agenda until I die
